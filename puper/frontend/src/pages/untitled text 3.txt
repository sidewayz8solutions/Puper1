My fellow New Orleanians,

It’s time to be Frank.
It’s time to be Frank in every sense of the word.

Frank with our words.
Frank with our hearts.
Frank with our future.

Because our city—our beloved New Orleans—cannot afford another day of failed leadership.

For too long, Mayor LaToya Cantrell has defiled the sacred trust of this office. She has disrespected our people, mismanaged our resources, and dragged our city’s name through shame and scandal.

And now, as we approach the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina—a day forever etched into the soul of our city—are we to let this mayor stand as the face of New Orleans? Are we to let her bring shame on a hallowed day when we should be honoring resilience, not remembering corruption?

No!

The people of New Orleans deserve better.
Our children deserve better.
Our future deserves better.

It is with clear voice and a clear conscience that I say: Mayor Cantrell, it is time for you to resign. Step down, and step aside, before this city marks the anniversary of Katrina with your failure still hanging over it.

You have done enough damage. Enough division. Enough disgrace.

Because the truth is this: the power belongs to us—the people.

And together, with courage, with honesty, and with unity, we will take our city back.
We will restore its dignity.
We will restore its greatness.

So LET ME BE Frank

Mayor Cantrell, resign.
Do the right thing for this city.
Do it now.
